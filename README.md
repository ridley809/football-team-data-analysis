# Team Performance Analysis

A **data analysis project** exploring a football team's player performances during a championship season.  
The analysis evaluates the impact of players on team performance in both attack and defense.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze player contributions and generate insights from performance data.  
Key points:
- Evaluate attack and defense impact of each player
- Generate visualizations to highlight trends and key performances
- Summarize findings in a presentation

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 3  
- pandas (data manipulation)  
- matplotlib / seaborn (data visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Project Structure
- `notebook.ipynb` → Python notebook containing all analyses and visualizations  
- `images/` → Folder containing generated plots and screenshots  
- `presentation/` → Optional: presentation file summarizing results (PPT)  
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  

## ▶️ Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/team-performance-analysis.git
   cd team-performance-analysis
   ```

## Installation and Usage

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
